In this tutorial you will focus on developing an application that will run in an environment using an assorted set of microservices patterns. The main purpose is to highlight how Spring Cloud helps in such an environment, to get an understanding of how it all works.

The tutorial is purposely designed to hold your hand and show you step by step what to do. The main goal is not to challenge your problem solving skills, instead we want to focus on presenting Spring Cloud concepts in small chunks, eventually leading up to a working application.

With that said, donâ€™t blindly just copy and paste the code without reflecting on it. The tutorial will try to make you think about things here and there, but if you find any step confusing or lacking in description, please bring it up during the session so we can discuss it.

== Overview of the application components
We are going to build a set of Java https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] components using https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud[Spring Cloud] tools. Some of these components will implement common microservices patterns used in distributed systems, such as centralized configuration and service discovery, and are hence of a more supportive nature:

Supporting components::
* Config Server
* Gateway
* Service Discovery and Client Loadbalancer

Along with the above we also need microservices that takes the role as our business components, the ones serving data that clients are interested in:

Business components::
* Web API
* Items Service

We will explain more about each component when we start working on them, but before getting started there is something to be said about _Maven_ and also _Spring Initializr_

== Maven
Maven is a build and dependency management tool widely used in the Java echo system.

[NOTE]
If you have been working with Java you can stop reading now, we are not going to say anything new on the matter. But please read on if you are not so familiar with Maven since it may save one or two WTF:s along the way.

At the core of a https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] project is the `pom.xml` file (stands for Project Object Model), which is an XML-representation of how the project is setup. In here you specify what should be built in the project, and all project dependencies to other components (internal or third-party) is declared here.

In the projects we are going to build there will be several dependencies to Spring Cloud components.

A Maven project is built by executing the command `mvn clean install`, which will automatically download all dependencies specified (and all dependencies these first dependencies in turn may require). This can take a while, like a minute or two. The download will only happen if any dependencies are missing on your computer, so the next time you build the console output will not be quite so busy as the first time.

The downloaded dependencies are typically stored under a directory named `.m2` in your user directory.

== Spring Initializr

Spring Boot provides a tool for quickly setting up a base Maven project with dependencies to various Spring components, which can be searched for and added to project in a wizard-like manner. https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr] basically creates a `pom.xml` file for you with everything needed for running the selected components.

You will use this tool when creating the components in this tutorial, which we incidentally will be start doing right now. Let's begin with the Config Server.
