|Task|Comment

|Created a central `config-server`
|

|Implemented `items-service` and `reviews-service`
|

|Added `service-discovery-server`
|We now utilize an _Eureka_ server that keeps track of services for us. It knows which _host_ and _port_ each service use, information that other Spring Cloud applications can use when needed.

|Enabled registering of existing `items-service` and `reviews-service` to registry
|Our example microservices register to the discovery server during startup. During their life time they send heartbeats at regular intervals, letting the discovery server know they are healthy.

|Created the `webapi` component which discover and calls the above services using the `service-discovery-server`.
|The BFF WebApi component uses _Spring Cloud OpenFeign_ for calling and aggregating responses from the microservices. OpenFeign clients do not explicitly know where these services are located, instead they fetch this information from the discovery server.

|Used Ribbon as Client load balancer
|

|Looked at Hystrix for fault tolerance and Resiliency
|

|Added `gateway` as main entrance
|

|Dabbled a bit with _Spring Security_ in the `gateway`
|

|Enabled tracing information to be able to track a request
