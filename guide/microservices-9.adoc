== Wrapping it up

=== End of the road

This is the end of the road, please pat yourself on a body part of your choice for celebrating the good work!

We have finally arrived at the solution we planned at the beginning of the tutorial.

Let us do a brief recapitulation before we close the session. This is what we did today.

|===
|Task|Comment

|Created a central `config-server`
|A central configuration store was implemented in the form of _Spring Cloud Config Server_. Microservices can connect and fetch configuration from this server, which is very meaningful if multiple instances of services are run.

|Implemented `items-service` and `reviews-service`
|The two "base" services we implemented are perhaps pretty dumb, but they showed us the concepts of exposing a REST-api for communication with other services, and how to become registered into a service discovery server.

|Added `service-discovery-server`
|We now utilize an _Eureka_ server that keeps track of services for us. It knows which _host_ and _port_ each service use, information that other Spring Cloud applications can use when needed.

|Enabled registering of existing `items-service` and `reviews-service` to registry
|Our example microservices register to the discovery server during startup. During their life time they send heartbeats at regular intervals, letting the discovery server know they are healthy. If they are not, they are thrown away without ceremony.

|Created the `webapi` component which discover and calls the above services using the `service-discovery-server`.
|The BFF WebApi component uses _Spring Cloud OpenFeign_ for calling and aggregating responses from the microservices. OpenFeign clients do not explicitly know where these services are located, instead they fetch this information from the discovery server.

|Used Ribbon as Client load balancer
|Ribbon helped us distributing the load evenly when we ran several instances of `items-service` and `reviews-service`. Ribbon keeps track of services and their host/ports by communicating closely with the `service-discovery-server`.

|Looked at Hystrix for fault tolerance and Resiliency
|When services fail we must take care to not bring the whole application down. Hystrix provides _short circuit_ functionality to avoid clients bombarding services that are not feeling so well. We tried the _fallback_ approach, in our case we returned an empty value if the underlying service was down.

|Added `gateway` as main entrance and dabbled a bit with _Spring Security_
|We added a gateway component that acted as a proxy. A filter made sure that clients could not be routed to other services than we allowed. It is common to let the gateway also handle authentication, which we tried by using _basic auth_.

|Enabled tracing information to be able to track a request
|Finally we added tracing capabilities so we could keep track of the path a request to the system took. This can be used with tools like _Zipkin_.
